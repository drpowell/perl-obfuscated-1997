It is basically a simple game where you must keep the '*' between the two
walls using the ',' and '.' keys.   First 3 lines opens source file itself, 
finds the 'print' statement in the middle of the code and decodes it.  Simply 
hex of ascii characters.  The eval then executes it which puts stdin in to 
unbuffered mode.  It also binds *_ to $OFMT so printing a number will print the 
contents of $_.  The rest is simply the game.  The sysread line reads the uses 
input then takes the appropriate regular expression from the @\ array, then 
modifies the output string (in $_).

The third last line moves the walls left or right depending on $p, and changes
direction when it reaches the edge or if a random condition is met.  The
random number is generated by the anon sub in $\[3].  The second last line
randomly shrinks the width, and the last is for crash detection.
